# Google-Mock-up

In this project I tried to replicate the aesthetics of the Google search page, The Image Search, and part of the Advanced search Page.

This was my first html and CSS project, after studying some fundamentals

I found I found this project quite challenging, it helped me a lot to understand in general:

- Which particular divs need to be modified by the css
- To use flexbox
- To use a bit of bootstrap
- And most importantly how to use Google's dev tools
